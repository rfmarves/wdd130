    <h3>General stuff</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, my name full name is René Fernando Marves Gómez (2 names and 2 last
      names, as it's customary in Latin America) and I'm from Guatemala, where I
      currently live. I'm 40 years old, father to a lovely 9-year-old girl, and
      have a little more than 10 years of being happily married.
    </p>
    <h3>Professional and computer stuff</h3>
    <p>
      I'm happy to be starting the path towards a bachelor in Software
      Development. I've done a lot of computer programming, mostly to automate
      things in MS Excel, but also some web, Python and R, but have very little
      formal studies in any of it. I work as a Financial Analyst and have a
      degree in Chemical Engineering, a master's in Marketing and a PMP
      certification.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've liked computer programming ever since my first exposure to it when I
      was in 3rd grade and programming in Logo: telling a little turtle what to
      do on the green screen of an Apple II.
    </p>
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
      I like to do many things, which usually gets me pulled in many directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mainly, I like making things. This takes the shape of making furniture and
      home repairs (from a table all the way to a full closet), electric work,
      electronics, plumbing, and gardening.
    </p>
    <p>
      My latest destinations for my free time are now 3D printing and studying
      here.
